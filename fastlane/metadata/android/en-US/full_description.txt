CircuitVerse aims to provide a platform where circuits can be designed and simulated using a graphical user interface. While users can design complete CPU implementations within the simulator, the software is designed primarily for educational use. CircuitVerse is an open-source project with an active community.

CircuitVerse has been designed to be very easy to use in class. The platform has features to assist teachers in class and assignments including but not limited to

1. Creating Groups and adding your students.
2. Posting Assignments.
3. Grading Assignments.
